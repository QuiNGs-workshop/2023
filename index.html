						<p class="h3">What, When, and Where</p>
						<p>QuINGs is a workshop for LGBTQ+ mathematicians who are early career researchers, from PhD students onwards. It is aimed at geometers and number theorists, but researchers in related areas and with an interest in these topics are welcome to apply. The event will take place at the <a href="https://westlexham.org/" target="_blank"> West Lexham retreat</a> in Norfolk for 3 days, from Wednesday, 30 August to Friday, 1 September 2023.</p>
						<p>The retreat will be held in person, and we aim to have around 30 participants from the UK and Europe. We will cover accommodation and full board for all participants. A coach service between West Lexham and nearby train stations will be provided (details closer to the event), but we expect participants to cover the rest of their travel costs.</p>

						<p class="h3">Why Number Theory and Geometry</p>
						<p>These two areas in mathematics are deeply related. Moreover, there is much potential for the cross-fertilisation of ideas from other fields. New geometry and number theory results are not only powered by other areas such as algebra, combinatorics, and mathematical physics but also inspire subsequent developments in them.</p>
						<p>To promote such interdisciplinary interactions and allow the dissemination of research, there will be plenary talks by world-leading researchers on a broad range of topics, with additional contributed talks weaving the numerous threads of geometry and number theory together.</p>

						<p class="h3">Why Queer</p>
						<p>In recent years it has become clear that a diverse and inclusive research community is more productive and is in a better position to positively impact society.
							The specific case of queer diversity was recently outlined in an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02354-y" target="_blank"> article </a> in Nature by Anthony Bonato. </p>
						<p>For queer researchers, each research connection, grant, and application involves a conscious decision of how much of one's queer/trans identity to disclose. This can be particularly critical when looking for PhD and postdoc supervisors at early career stages. We hope QuINGs will help create a safe space for queer mathematicians to form and solidify new and existing collaborative networks in a safe space. In the long term, we aim to make queer people feel more welcome to mathematical research, helping it become more diverse and inclusive.</p>
						<p>To promote connections between participants we will have a community-building discussion to talk about the experiences and challenges that queer mathematicians face. In this way, one may discover other open queer academics who have faced and overcome similar challenges. Indeed, having mathematical role models in under-represented groups is especially important for fostering a sense of belonging as well as the confidence that it is possible to succeed in an academic environment.</p>
						<p>This conference builds on the success of the previous EDI initiatives <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahhgr/wings.html" target="_blank"> WINGs </a> and <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/SpecQ" target="_blank">Spec(<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">&#x211A;</SPAN>)</a>.</p>

						<p>Tyler Kelly is an associate professor at the University of Birmingham, researching algebraic geometry. Their research mainly focuses on mirror symmetry and Landau-Ginzburg models, with interests both in the enumerative and homological points of view. Kelly started a PhD in 2009 at the University of Pennsylvania as an elaborate ruse to learn more mathematics, believing it would only work for two years until the faculty realised that they were bad at mathematics in the oral exam and promptly kick them out of the PhD. Twelve years after the oral exam, and after finishing a PhD at Penn in 2014 and a postdoc in Cambridge, they’re still here. Easy safe topics to bring up with them in discussion include: knitting, Eurovision, and, begrudgingly, Drag Race.</p>

The LLC is divided into two parts: first, there is the tame or depth-zero part, where much is known and proofs tend to be uniform for all residue characteristics p. Then there are the unexplored depths of the wild part of the correspondence, where many uniform statements no longer hold. In this wild part we see the most beautiful interactions between Galois theory and Lie theory. The aim of this talk is to give a glimpse of these interactions through examples. I will not assume any background knowledge of p-adic groups.">Beth Romano: Wild inertia and the local Langlands correspondence</button>

One method is via Le Potier functions, which characterise the existence of slope-semistable vector bundles.

A stronger uniform version, which is still open for cubics, requires c to depend only on the degree of X, the dimension of the ambient space, and \epsilon. 
							In this talk I will report on ongoing work, in which we study and generalize uniform dimension growth type bounds in the affine case, using a new effective higher dimensional variant of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem.

Classically, Kronecker tackled the problem of constructing abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields, known as the &quot;Kronecker Jugendtraum&quot;, via singular moduli, values of modular functions at imaginary quadratic points of the complex upper half plane.  The theory of complex multiplication is also employed in the construction of Heegner points, global points on elliptic curves playing a crucial role in the proof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture in rank 1. 
							In recent years, Darmon and collaborators have proposed a (conjectural) theory of &quot;real multiplication&quot; relying on p-adic methods. In particular, conjectural analogues of Heegner points and singular moduli for real quadratic fields have been obtained exploiting the geometry of the Drinfeld p-adic upper half plane.  In this talk, I will discuss aspects of the theory of complex multiplication and compare them with their analogues for real quadratic fields. I will then present a result confirming the conjectural properties of singular moduli in a special case. ">Alice Pozzi: Towards a theory of real multiplication</button>

The Chow ring is generated by closed substacks of $\overline{\ca M}_{g,n}$, with the product being the intersection. This ring is very useful, but sometimes does not contain enough information. In my talk, I introduce the \emph{log Chow ring} of $\overline{\ca M}_{g,n}$, a ring containing information about all the blowups of $\overline{\ca M}_{g,n}$ in boundary strata, and show how some classical invariants have a natural, better behaved lift to log Chow. The one disadvantage of the log Chow ring, is that the pullback along the \emph{gluing maps} of a blowup is not necessarily a blowup, and hence there are no maps relating the log Chow rings of $\overline{\ca M}_{g,n}$ for differing $g,n$. 
							I’ll explain this issue, explain how to solve it, and give an application by showing that log double ramification cycles form a partial log cohomological field theory.
